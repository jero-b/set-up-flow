ANDROID WORKFLOW GUIDE
#notes on how and what to install and do when setting up an ANDROID phone or TABLET as fresh install or purchase.

HARDWARE OPTIONS
When choosing an android phone there are six criteria that needs to be met.
1. It must support 5G and 4G cellular connection. For tablet at least wifi a/b/g/n/ac/x or at least wifi 6 or newer.
2. Minimum of 1080p screen resolution 1.5k resolution screen are perfect for mobile phones and for tablet around 1440p or 2k screen resolution.
3. Sizes for phones must be around 6.0 inch - 6.8 inch screen. Above that are too large for a phone within my hand. For tablet must be around 10 inch - 13.5 inch. 
4. Storage must at least be 128g or above. RAM must be at least 4g or above the bigger ram and storage the better.
5. Must have SD card slot. 
6. Fast camera capture with decent images. For tablet it must support display out or pen.

CHOOSING A FLAVOR (Android Version)
1. Any newest android version will be acceptable. But if not available at least two generation behind will suffice. For example the latest is android 15, the least minimum would be android 13. Android 14 will be good, android 12 and below is a big NO. 

BRAND SELECTION
1. This guide has no brand loyalty. Buy whatever suits the above qualifications. International and local brands as long as they are good with the above requirements they're considered.
2. Always do watch a comprehensive video review of the phone. Not just from one source but multiple sources like: multiple youtube videos both mainstream and independent youtuber., website blogs and forums.
3. Don't be to swift and rush to buy, do your research well.

FIRST BOOT
1. Immediately set-up a password or any security feature that you prefer. Neglecting this might results in unfavorable circumstances.
2. Then try the connections and ports, make sure you can connect to a wifi network, you can connect to mobile data, the speakers are working and camera is responsive. SD card should also be working. Make sure the top 6 criteria are met.
3. Try installing some random apps, open it, play with it a little, then reboot the phone. or tablet.
4. Redo step number 2.
5. If step number 4 is OK. Then proceed setting up your accounts and data.
6. If you use google backup then use it. It's convenient but I don't recommend it.
7. After setting up the above steps. Try installing your needed apps and games, change wallpaper, and customize the phone base on your preference. Proceed to APPS AND GAMES below. For what to install.
8. Disable or opt out to any user experience and targeted advertising bullshit the manufacturer or any app you have.
9. Adjust settings based on your liking. Adjust control panel, rearrange launcher and homescreen.
10. The default launcher would suffice. If it is really that horrible then install a different one then adjust and customize to your liking.
11. Uninstall or disable unwanted bloatware.
12. After step 9, 10 and 11 do a final reboot.
