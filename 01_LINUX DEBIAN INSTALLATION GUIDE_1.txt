LINUX WORKFLOW GUIDE
#notes on how and what to install and do when setting up a Linux laptop or PC as fresh install.

CHOOSING A DISTRO (Distribution)
When choosing a distro there are five criteria that needs to be met.
1. WIFI or LAN must work, preferably wifi, bonus if Bluetooth or BT tether function also works out of the box.
2. KEYBOARD works automatically before, during and after distro installation.
3. PORTS AND CONNECTIONS are functioning before, during and after installation. USB-A and USB-C must be working. If headphone combo jack, SD card reader or CD-rom reader also work that is a plus.
4. DRIVER AND MONITOR support must be supported. Most intel and AMD processors support integrated graphics on linux but make sure it works also with discreet and dedicated GPU like NVIDAs and AMDs.
5. MOUSEPAD must be working and functional, modern laptop have gesture support and multi point touch, also check if it is supported by your distro and laptop.

When selecting a Distribution only 3 distro comes to mind. Those are:
1. DEBIAN LINUX
2. ARCH LINUX
4. FEDORA
Any of those 3 will work just fine. If wanting to try to install it on older and lower spec devices, these 3 are the contenders:
1. ANTIX LINUX
2. MINI OS - a linux distribution based on debian
3. PUPPY LINUX
Other linux distros are still in waiting list mode. Other distros and OS's that would be interesting temporarily are FREE BSD and VOID LINUX.

DEBIAN Installation Guide:
1. Choosing a boot installation IMAGE or ISO. Always select the standard option. In Debian they label it as 'cd_1 or cd1' or for a more safer option but consume more data and storage space the one label with 'dvd1 or dvd_1'. There are also other flavor and installation option to choose from. 
2. Always try the live version first.
3. Always disable secure boot in your device BIOS and enable legacy boot, especially if your device comes with a pre-installed Windows in it. Disabling secure boot enables you to boot a USB bootable device. Sometimes linux wont install grub bootloader on hardisk because UEFI, EFI, UFI is enable in boot option, you can disable it or change it to legacy support.
4. INSTALLATION WALK-TROUGH REFERENCE .Use the grub installer when installing. Note that this is a general reference guide for me, created by me. This is not a literal step by step installation guide. Use this a reference only.
a. language/region - english US
b. keyboard layout - english US, english PH
c. network configuration (you can just skip or disable connecting to network for now)
d. desktop environment - GNOME, CINNAMON, KDE and XFCE/LXQT. GNOME AND CINNAMON will always be the first choice for laptop. In the installation you might ask which one to install and use. But if you are using a flavored version with DE in it then you can skip this.
e. disk partitioning - on some cases going with the default partitioning works. On some cases manually partitioning might be the better choice. Remember: in linux you need two important partition, the "file partition" this is where you install the OS and bootloader, and then the "swap partition" also known as linux swap image.
	- file partition: "/" have the ext4 file drive system. The most important
	partition. Mostly the largest volume in the partitions.
	- swap partition: a swap image partition, the default size is 1G but can be
	increase. The rule of thumb is your swap must be the size or more of your
	RAM. e.g. 4G of RAM = 4G of swap or more.
	- EFI partition: on some cases linux installer have the default EFI
	partition for PC or laptop that support UEFI boot. Some installer label it 
	as FAT32 boot partition. (you can delete this partition if your device
	doesn't support UEFI. On the other hand even if your device support it
	you can just ignore it by disabling secure boot and enabling legacy boot.)
	There are some cases that by allowing EFI partition your bootloader won't
	install and might end up a broken installation.

DISPLAY MANAGER
Display manager comes by default in most flavor of every distribution. You may skip this if you have an already install DE distro.
Install a display manager: A display manager is responsible for handling login and graphical sessions.
LightDM 
	sudo apt-get install lightdm
	or:
	sudo apt install lightdm
GDM3
	sudo apt-get install gdm3
	or:
	sudo apt install gdm3
KDM - if using KDE
	sudo apt-get install sddm
	or:
	sudo apt install sddm 
To remove the Display manager: ignore the []
	sudo apt-get remove [insert display manager name]
	or:
	sudo apt remove [insert display manager name]
However, if you have multiple display managers installed, you can choose between them using: Ignore the []
	sudo dpkg-reconfigure [insert display manager name]
You can use any display manager's name in place of [insert display manager name] in the above command, and it will allow you to choose between them. You must reboot for the change to take affect.
To check which display manager is currently being used, run this command:
	cat /etc/X11/default-display-manager
	or:
	systemctl status display-manager
Stop and disable Display Manager:
	systemctl stop [DM name].service
	systemctl disable [DM name].service

INSTALL GNOME
There are 3 versions of GNOME, the full desktop, the minimal and the vanilla.
Install full gnome: includes games and other apps like libre office. 2gig
	sudo apt install gnome-desktop
	or:
	sudo apt install task-gnome-desktop
	or:
	sudo apt install gnome/stable
Install minimal gnome: without the extra apps. 800mb
	sudo apt install gnome-desktop-minimal
Install vanilla gnome: the most strip down version.
	sudo apt install vanilla-gnome-desktop
REMOVING GNOME:
	sudo apt-get purge gnome*
	sudo apt-get autoremove
	
INSTALL KDE
KDE uses SDDM display manager, a configuration window module may pop to select SDDM. There are 3 variations of KDE. The full, the standard and the minimal.
Full-Fledged KDE Experience:
	sudo apt install kde-full
Balanced KDE Standard:
	sudo apt install kde-standard
Minimalist KDE Plasma Desktop:
	sudo apt install kde-plasma-desktop
REMOVING KDE:
	sudo apt autoremove '^kde' '^plasma' --purge

INSTALL CINNAMON
cinnamon is like an old gnome with some kde. LightDM is a good choice for cinnamon.
install the cinnamon desktop environment:
	sudo apt install task-cinnamon-desktop
REMOVE CINNAMON:
	sudo apt autoremove '^cinnamon' task-cinnamon-desktop --purge
	
INSTALL XFCE
LightDM is a good choice for xfce.
Install XFCE
	sudo apt install task-xfce-desktop
REMOVE XFCE
	sudo apt autoremove '^xfce' task-xfce-desktop --purge
Should you come across a scenario where a blue screen appears solely during the installation process, you might need to execute the subsequent command:
	sudo apt install xorgxrdp

COMMON PROBLEMS IN DISPLAY MANAGER WHEN SWITCHING OR INSTALLING DE's.
1. Display Manager Not Starting
If LightDM fails to start, check the system logs and ensure that the service is enabled:
	sudo systemctl status lightdm
	sudo systemctl enable lightdm
command above also works with other DM, just change lightdm to the name of prefered DM.

2. Desktop Environment Not Loading
If the desktop environment doesnâ€™t load after rebooting, check the display manager configuration file:
	sudo nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf
Ensure that the following line is present and uncommented:
	greeter-session=example-gtk-gnome

3. Missing Graphical Packages
If you encounter missing graphical packages, install the required dependencies:
	sudo apt install -f
